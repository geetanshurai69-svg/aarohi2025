                <p>Your name means a rise, a journey upwards, a quiet strength that grows with time.</p>
                <p>And that is exactly how you exist in my life. You lift my days without trying, you make me believe in better things, just by being you.</p>
                <p>My name is <strong>Geetanshu</strong>, a soul of songs. And maybe that is why destiny chose you, because every song needs a rise to feel complete.</p>
                <p>When my <em>geet</em> meets your <em>aarohi</em>, it finally knows where to go.</p>
                <p>Beyond names and meanings, you are my comfort, my excitement, my peace.</p>
                <p>You are the reason I smile without checking the time, and the reason my heart feels sure.</p>
                <p>On your birthday, I wish you growth, happiness, and endless light. May you always keep rising, and may I always walk beside you.</p>
                <p><strong>Happy Birthday. Always yours.</strong></p>
