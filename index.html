                <p>Your name means a rise,<br>A journey upwards,<br>A quiet strength that grows with time.</p>
                <p>And that is exactly how you exist in my life.<br>You lift my days without trying,<br>You make me believe in better things,<br>Just by being you.</p>
                <p>My name is <strong>Geetanshu</strong>, a soul of songs.<br>And maybe that is why destiny chose you,<br>Because every song needs a rise to feel complete.</p>
                <p>When my <em>geet</em> meets your <em>aarohi</em>,<br>It finally knows where to go.</p>
                <p>Beyond names and meanings,<br>You are my comfort, my excitement, my peace.<br>You are the reason I smile without checking the time,<br>And the reason my heart feels sure.</p>
                <p>On your birthday, I wish you growth, happiness, and endless light.<br>May you always keep rising,<br>And may I always walk beside you.</p>
                <p><strong>Happy Birthday. Always yours.</strong></p>
